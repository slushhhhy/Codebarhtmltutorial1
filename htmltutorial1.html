        The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the
        only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as
        the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.[4]
        The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral
        cat, which ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] A house cat is
        valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents.
        About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
